## Project Overview
This project is a web application designed to allow users to view and cancel their purchases. Users will authenticate via OTP (One-Time Password) and access their orders for the day. The application includes:

- A login screen where users input their country code and mobile number.
- OTP validation and authentication process.
- An order list screen displaying the user's purchases.
- An order details screen where users can view their order items and cancel an order if needed.

## Technologies Used

### **Svelte**
- **Why?**
  - Svelte is a modern frontend framework that compiles components into highly efficient JavaScript.
  - It eliminates the need for a virtual DOM, resulting in faster updates and a better user experience.
  - Its reactive nature makes it easy to manage state changes, such as displaying updated order details after a cancellation.

### **Tailwind CSS**
- **Why?**
  - Provides utility-first styling, making it easier to create a responsive and modern UI.
  - Speeds up development by reducing the need to write custom CSS.
  - Ensures consistency across the application with predefined styles and design patterns.

## Project Flow

1. **User Authentication (OTP Flow):**
   - The user enters their country code and mobile number.
   - A request is sent to the server to generate an OTP.
   - The user inputs the OTP received via SMS.
   - The OTP is validated, and upon success, the user is authenticated.

2. **Orders Listing:**
   - After successful login, the user is redirected to the order list screen.
   - A request is sent to the server to fetch the day's orders.
   - The orders are displayed in a structured format with relevant details.

3. **Order Details:**
   - When the user clicks on an order, a request is made to retrieve order details and items.
   - The details are displayed, including a list of items in the order.
   - The user is presented with two buttons:
     - **Return Button:** Navigates back to the order list.
     - **Cancel Button:** Cancels the order by sending an update request to the server.

4. **Canceling an Order:**
   - When the cancel button is clicked, a request is sent to update the order status.
   - The UI updates to reflect the cancellation status.
